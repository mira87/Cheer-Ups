## Technical Requirements - Performing

Full CRUD functionality is present on one or two models.

- Nice job!

## Creativity and Interface - Performing

The app displays a personal spin or creative element through its written language, functionality, purpose, and/or CSS.

- It looks really good in the browser! If you have time in the future, consider using CSS technologies like Grid/Flexbox/media queries to make your app even more responsive on mobile.

## Code Quality - Excelling

No major code quality issues, makes use of JS best practices appropriately, and follows techniques such as separation of concerns, abstraction, and encapsulation

- Nice job separating out your files into models, views, and controllers!
- Make sure to clean up/remove any random whitespaces in your js files (e.g., https://github.com/mira87/Cheer-Ups/blob/master/controllers/cheer.js)
- Also, make sure your indentation is consistent throughout all your files (pick either 2 or 4 spaces for your indentation)
- Make sure to add your `node_modules` to `.gitignore`

## Functionality - Excelling

App has advanced functionality that works with minimal errors, and may make use of advanced tools such as APIs, plugins, etc.

- I love the social media share integration you built!

## Planning/Process/Submission - Performing

Submission contains clear evidence of planning, adequate documentation, include all from previous category, as well as additional information such as unsolved issues. Submission includes a readme and planning directory.

- Nice job with the user stories and wireframes! Nice job on your screencast as well! For your readme, I think there were some formatting issues with your headings which cause them to not render properly on the page. Take a look at an example of a good readme: https://github.com/jaredsmorgan/smART

## Additional Feedback

- Take a look at some of my inline comments on your code.
- Take a look at how I've used the prettier plugin to automatically clean up your code formatting!
